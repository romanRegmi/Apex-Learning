# Apex Security

## Private access modifiers

* Can only be called inside the same class.
* This is the default access modifier for inner class. If we don't specify any access modifier for an inner class, it is considered Private.
* Top level classes can have either public or global but cannot have private access modifiers.
* Top level classes can have a private access modifier if it is used with `@isTest` annotation.

## Public access modifiers

* Public class is visible in the application or namespace and can be called from other classes in the same namespace.

## Protected access modifiers

* If a protected variable or method is declared in class A, the variable can be called in class B iff B extends class A. 

## Global access modifiers

* Global class is visible everywhere in the org.
* A class with webservice method must be declared as global.
* If a method or inner class is declared as global then the outer, top-level class must also be defined as global.

## Interview Questions

### 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐄𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐚 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝 𝐨𝐫 𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞❓

Apex doesn’t enforce object-level and field-level permissions by default. 

Object permissions & FLS of running user can be enforced by calling the sObject describe result methods (of `𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚.𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐞𝐒𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭`) and the field describe result method (of `𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚.𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚.𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐞𝐅𝐢𝐞𝐥𝐝𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭`)

We can verify whether the 𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐫 has permissions to perform the DML or query.

Enforcing these methods require more work as a developer and occupy more lines of code.

The following methods from the Schema.DescribeSObjectResult can be called to verify whether the user has 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝, 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞, 𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐞 𝐨𝐫 𝐮𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐨𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭.

### Mastering Apex Security in Salesforce — WITH USER_MODE vs WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED vs stripInaccessible() 🔐⚙️

🔷 1️⃣ Understanding Field & Object-Level Security — Why It Matters 🔎
✅ Apex runs in system mode by default, meaning it ignores field- and object-level security (FLS/OLS) unless explicitly handled
✅ To comply with data visibility rules and avoid exposing sensitive data, you must enforce these manually
💡 Tip for Admin: Apex bypasses security unless you instruct it otherwise. This is critical in managed packages, public sites, or API integrations.

🔷 2️⃣ stripInaccessible() — Clean Your Data After You Query 🧹
✅ Filters out fields not accessible to the current user (FLS/OLS) after a query or DML
✅ Used for read, create, and update operations


```java
// Example: Read-safe query
Account acc = [SELECT Id, Name, AnnualRevenue FROM Account LIMIT 1];
SObjectAccessDecision decision = Security.stripInaccessible(AccessType.READABLE, acc);

Account secureAcc = (Account)decision.getRecords()[0];

// 🧠 Best Insight: Bulk-safe sanitization of queried records before sending to UI or downstream logic.
```

```java
public static Opportunity getFinDetails(Id oppId){
    String soql = 'SELECT Purchase_Order_No__c, Discount_Percentage__c';
    if (Schema.sObjectType.Opportunity.fields.Credit_Card_No__c.isAccessible()) {
        soql += ', Credit_Card_No__c';
    }
    soql += ' from Opportunity WHERE Id =: oppId';
    return (Database.query(String.escapeSingleQuotes(soql))); //prevent injection attack
}
```


🔷 3️⃣ WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED 🔐
✅ Enforces FLS and OLS at the SOQL level
✅ Throws a runtime exception if a field or object is inaccessible
✅ Available in Apex SELECT queries only
- `WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED` is not applied for the fields used in the WHERE clause.
- `WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED` is not applied for polymorphic fields (Owner, Task.WhatId, etc).
- `WITH SECURITY ENFORCED` finds only the first error.
It cannot enforce sharing rules.
If any of the fields or objects access is not there for the user, then a query Exception is thrown. No data is returned.

```java
// Safe SOQL
Account[] accs = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED];
```
⚠️ Caution: This throws an exception if the user doesn’t have access. Use try-catch to gracefully handle failures in custom UIs. When applying field-level security in a SOQL query, don't use `WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED` rather use `WITH USER_MODE`.

🧠 Best Insight: Precise Apex queries with explicit access enforcement and failure detection.

🔷 4️⃣ WITH USER_MODE
✅ Used with Database.insert(), update(), delete() and similar methods
✅ Enforces FLS, OLS, and sharing rules automatically — mimics running “as user”
✅ Prevents insertion/update of inaccessible fields without manual checks
1. It applies to the fields in the WHERE class as well.
2. It applies to SOSL and polymorphic queries as well.
3. This can capture all the fields that the user doesn't have access to, rather than throwing an exception the moment it encounters the first inaccessible field.
4. This can enforce sharing rules.
5. The WITH USER_MODE supports lots of new innovations like restriction rules, scoping rules, and any other security operations for data access and CRUD/FLS that may be added by the platform in the future.

```java
// Safe insert with user-mode DML
Account newAcc = new Account(Name='Acme', AnnualRevenue=2000000);
Database.insert(newAcc, new Database.InsertOptions(Database.UserMode.ENFORCED));
```
🧠 Best Insight: Declarative-safe DML operations where system mode isn’t appropriate — great for triggers, flows, LWC controller classes.

🧠 Best Practices for Apex Developers:

✔️ Always use FLS checks in Apex — Apex ignores security by default
✔️ Prefer WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED for clean query failures, and stripInaccessible() for silent sanitization

✔️ Use UserMode.ENFORCED in controller classes or flow-triggered invocable Apex

✔️ Add test methods to assert proper enforcement of user visibility (runAs scenarios)

✔️ Document which security method is used where — make your code auditable


### What is a Trace Flag?
A Trace Flag is a special setting in Salesforce that captures detailed information about the execution of Apex code. It records various events, such as the execution of Apex methods, SOQL queries, and DML operations, and writes them to a log file. Developers can then use this log file to analyze the performance of their code and identify any issues or bottlenecks. Trace Flags can be enabled for a specific user, set of users, or for the entire organization.


### If Apex runs in `without sharing` then why do we have the keyword `without sharing`?
A class with no declaration behaves in whatever mode was set from the calling class or context. 

When using `without sharing`, the mode is always changed to ignore the sharing rules. 

Class A → with Sharing
Class B → No sharing keyword used 

Class A invoked Class B

Output → Both Class A and Class B run as “with sharing” context because parent class or calling class is “with sharing”


Class A → with sharing
Class B → without sharing

Class A invoked Class B

Output → Class A runs in `with sharing` context while class B runs in `without sharing` context.

### Where to use Trace Flags?

Trace Flags are commonly used for debugging and troubleshooting Apex code in the following scenarios:


Debugging Apex code — Trace Flags help developers identify and resolve issues with Apex code by providing a detailed log of its execution.

Analyzing performance — Trace Flags allow developers to monitor the performance of Apex code and identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

Debugging issues with integrations — Trace Flags can be used to debug issues with integrations between Salesforce and other systems.

## Considerations

`𝐖𝐈𝐓𝐇 𝐒𝐄𝐂𝐔𝐑𝐈𝐓𝐘_𝐄𝐍𝐅𝐎𝐑𝐂𝐄𝐃`

Enforces object and field-level security (FLS) while respecting the class sharing model (with sharing, without sharing, or inherited sharing).
Use this when you want FLS enforced but need control over sharing behavior.

`𝐖𝐈𝐓𝐇 𝐔𝐒𝐄𝐑_𝐌𝐎𝐃𝐄`

Enforces FLS, CRUD, and sharing together — regardless of the class sharing keyword.
It behaves exactly like the logged-in user accessing data from the UI.

### So which one should you use?

UI-driven logic (LWC/Aura, user-triggered actions) :
Prefer `𝐔𝐒𝐄𝐑_𝐌𝐎𝐃𝐄` for complete user-context security.

Service layer, admin logic, cross-record visibility :
Use `𝐖𝐈𝐓𝐇 𝐒𝐄𝐂𝐔𝐑𝐈𝐓𝐘_𝐄𝐍𝐅𝐎𝐑𝐂𝐄𝐃` when sharing should not be automatically enforced.

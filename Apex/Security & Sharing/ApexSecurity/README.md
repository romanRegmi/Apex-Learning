## Private access modifiers

* Can only be called inside the same class.
* This is the default access modifier for inner class. If we don't specify any access modifier for an inner class, it is considered Private.
* Top level classes can have either public or global but cannot have private access modifiers.
* Top level classes can have a private access modifier if it is used with `@isTest` annotation.

## Public access modifiers

* Public class is visible in the application or namespace and can be called from other classes in the same namespace.

## Protected access modifiers

* If a protected variable or method is declared in class A, the variable can be called in class B iff B extends class A. 

## Global access modifiers

* Global class is visible everywhere in the org.
* A class with webservice method must be declared as global.
* If a method or inner class is declared as global then the outer, top-level class must also be defined as global.

## Interview Questions

### 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐄𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐚 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝 𝐨𝐫 𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞❓

Apex doesn’t enforce object-level and field-level permissions by default. 

Object permissions & FLS of running user can be enforced by calling the sObject describe result methods (of `𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚.𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐞𝐒𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭`) and the field describe result method (of `𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚.𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚.𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐞𝐅𝐢𝐞𝐥𝐝𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭`)

We can verify whether the 𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐫 has permissions to perform the DML or query.

Enforcing these methods require more work as a developer and occupy more lines of code.

The following methods from the Schema.DescribeSObjectResult can be called to verify whether the user has 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝, 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞, 𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐞 𝐨𝐫 𝐮𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐨𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭.

🔷 4️⃣ WITH USER_MODE
✅ Used with Database.insert(), update(), delete() and similar methods
✅ Enforces FLS, OLS, and sharing rules automatically — mimics running “as user”
✅ Prevents insertion/update of inaccessible fields without manual checks
1. It applies to the fields in the WHERE class as well.
2. It applies to SOSL and polymorphic queries as well.
3. This can capture all the fields that the user doesn't have access to, rather than throwing an exception the moment it encounters the first inaccessible field.
4. This can enforce sharing rules.
5. The WITH USER_MODE supports lots of new innovations like restriction rules, scoping rules, and any other security operations for data access and CRUD/FLS that may be added by the platform in the future.

```java
// Safe insert with user-mode DML
Account newAcc = new Account(Name='Acme', AnnualRevenue=2000000);
Database.insert(newAcc, new Database.InsertOptions(Database.UserMode.ENFORCED));
```
🧠 Best Insight: Declarative-safe DML operations where system mode isn’t appropriate — great for triggers, flows, LWC controller classes.

🧠 Best Practices for Apex Developers:

✔️ Always use FLS checks in Apex — Apex ignores security by default

✔️ Use UserMode.ENFORCED in controller classes or flow-triggered invocable Apex

✔️ Add test methods to assert proper enforcement of user visibility (runAs scenarios)

✔️ Document which security method is used where — make your code auditable


### What is a Trace Flag?
A Trace Flag is a special setting in Salesforce that captures detailed information about the execution of Apex code. It records various events, such as the execution of Apex methods, SOQL queries, and DML operations, and writes them to a log file. Developers can then use this log file to analyze the performance of their code and identify any issues or bottlenecks. Trace Flags can be enabled for a specific user, set of users, or for the entire organization.


### If Apex runs in `without sharing` then why do we have the keyword `without sharing`?
A class with no declaration behaves in whatever mode was set from the calling class or context. 

When using `without sharing`, the mode is always changed to ignore the sharing rules. 

Class A → with Sharing
Class B → No sharing keyword used 

Class A invoked Class B

Output → Both Class A and Class B run as “with sharing” context because parent class or calling class is “with sharing”


Class A → with sharing
Class B → without sharing

Class A invoked Class B

Output → Class A runs in `with sharing` context while class B runs in `without sharing` context.

### Where to use Trace Flags?

Trace Flags are commonly used for debugging and troubleshooting Apex code in the following scenarios:


Debugging Apex code — Trace Flags help developers identify and resolve issues with Apex code by providing a detailed log of its execution.

Analyzing performance — Trace Flags allow developers to monitor the performance of Apex code and identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

Debugging issues with integrations — Trace Flags can be used to debug issues with integrations between Salesforce and other systems.

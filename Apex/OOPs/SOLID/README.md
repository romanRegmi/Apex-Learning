* SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE (SRP)
* OPEN/CLOSED PRINCIPLE
* LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE
* INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE
* DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE




// Open/Closed Principle : Software entities(classes, modules, functions, etc) should be open for extension, but closed (as little changes as possible) for modification. 



//LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE : All subclasses of a super class need to be able to implement all the super class methods without an error occuring.


// INTERFACE {OOP interface not UI} SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE : "ONLY MAKE YOUR CODE DEPEND ON WHAT IT TRULY NEEDS TO DEPEND ON"

THE GOAL IS TO SEPARATE THE DETAILS (UI, BATCH CLASSES, ETC) FROM THE CONCRETE HIGH LEVEL IMPLEMENTATIONS (TYPICALLY SERVICE CLASSES/BUSINESS LOGIC)

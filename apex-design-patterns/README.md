What Are Apex Design Patterns?
Design patterns are best practices and proven solutions to to recurring design problems encountered during software development. These design patterns serve as guiding principles, aiding in structuring and organizing code to enhance efficiency, maintainability, and scalability of applications. The patterns not only streamline the development process but also contribute to building a robust foundation for future modifications and expansions.

Design patterns can be grouped into three main categories based on their purpose and usage.

Creational Patterns - Creational Patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexible ways to create instances of classes or objects enhancing reusability and control during instance creation. Eg: Singleton, Fatory, Abstract Factory etc

Structural Patterns - Structural patterns focus on organizing classes and objects into larger, clear structures, promoting better code organization and flexibility. Eg : Adapter, Bridge etc

Behavioral Patterns - Behavioral patterns concentrate on the communication between classes and objects, optimizing delegation of responsibilities and enhancing system collaboration and flexibility. Eg : Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter. 


**Type Of Apex Design Patterns**
Here are some common patterns we will be discussing in this article:

Singleton Pattern - It's a creational design pattern which restricts the instantiation of a class to one “single” instance only within a single transaction context.

Strategy Pattern - It’s behavioral design pattern that is used when there are multiples solutions to the same problem and solution or strategy to be selected at runtime.

Decorator Pattern - It's structural design pattern that allows the introduction of new temporary fields for processing without altering the object structure.

Facade Pattern - It's structural design pattern that provide the simpler interface and hides the complexity of complex classes.

Bulk State Transition Pattern - It's behavioral design pattern that is used to perform bulk actions based on the change of state of one or more records.
